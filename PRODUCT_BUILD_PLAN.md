# Climate Fund Watch — Full Product Build Plan

**Product name (global):** Climate Fund Watch (CFW)  
**Reference pilot brand:** ClimateFunds Watch Mauritius  
**Document type:** Country-agnostic product, architecture, and delivery plan  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Build-ready product plan  

---

## 1. Executive summary

Climate Fund Watch is a **digital public good** that makes climate finance **traceable, community-verified, and integrity-safe**. It combines:

1. A **public transparency platform** for climate projects, budgets, milestones, and open data.  
2. A **strictly isolated whistleblower / integrity channel** for safe reporting of misuse, fraud, and greenwashing.  
3. **Subnational operational dashboards** for local governments and implementing agencies.  
4. **Open APIs and scorecards** so media, CSOs, auditors, and researchers can independently verify claims.

The product is designed as a **multi-country, multi-tenant platform** with a shared core and **country packs** (law, language, admin boundaries, funder catalogs, risk layers). Mauritius is the reference pilot; the same core must deploy for any country with minimal code forks.

**One-line product definition**

> A mobile-first climate finance transparency platform with open project/budget tracking, community evidence, and a cryptographically isolated anonymous integrity channel—configurable for any country.

## 2. Problem, users, and theory of change

### 2.1 Universal problem

Climate finance is rising worldwide, but delivery fails for similar reasons across countries:

| Failure mode | Citizen impact |
|--------------|----------------|
| Fragmented project reporting | No single source of truth |
| Weak budget-to-site traceability | Money disappears between approval and community |
| Limited local authority visibility | Delays and mis-prioritization |
| Unsafe or absent integrity channels | Corruption and greenwashing go unreported |
| Closed data | Media/NGOs cannot audit independently |
| Low connectivity / language barriers | Excluded communities cannot participate |

### 2.2 Theory of change

**If** governments and partners publish climate projects and budget flows on a shared platform, communities can submit field evidence, and whistleblowers can report integrity risks safely, **and** local/national actors act on alerts under clear SLAs, **then** delays and misuse are detected earlier, trust rises, and adaptation resources reach vulnerable communities more fairly and effectively.

### 2.3 Primary user roles (global)

| Role | Goals | Access |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Citizen / resident** | See projects near me; report stalled/poor works | Public + evidence submit |
| **Whistleblower** | Report misuse without retaliation | Anonymous integrity vault |
| **Community verifier / CSO** | Confirm/dispute field signals | Elevated public + moderation tools |
| **Local government officer** | Update projects; act on delays/reports | Council/municipality console |
| **National climate finance unit** | Portfolio oversight; donor reporting | National console |
| **Implementing agency / contractor** | Milestone updates (controlled) | Limited contributor access |
| **Auditor / media / researcher** | Bulk data, APIs, exports | Public open data |
| **Integrity case handler** | Process confidential cases | Trusted zone only |
| **Platform operator / super-admin** | Tenant config, security, uptime | Ops console |
| **Donor / DFI analyst** | Portfolio transparency analytics | Public + optional premium |

---

## 3. Product principles (non-negotiable)

1. **Two-zone architecture** — Public transparency and whistleblower data never share identity links.  
2. **Open by default for public money** — Projects, budgets, milestones, and scorecards are public unless law requires redaction.  
3. **Anonymous by default for integrity reports** — No account required; case-code follow-up only.  
4. **Country-configurable, not country-forked** — One codebase; config/packs per country.  
5. **Offline-aware inclusion** — SMS/WhatsApp/USSD/hotline bridges where needed.  
6. **Standards-aligned data** — Prefer IATI, Open Contracting, ISO 3166, admin boundary standards.  
7. **Security and privacy as product features** — DPIA-ready; pen-tested before integrity launch.  
8. **Institutional co-ownership + independent integrity oversight** — Avoid “regulator audits itself only.”  
9. **Open source where possible** — Public tracker core should be publishable as a digital public good.  
10. **Action over dashboards** — Every alert has an owner, SLA, and public aggregate outcome.

---

## 4. Product vision and success definition

### 4.1 Vision (5 years)

Climate Fund Watch is the default **climate finance accountability layer** for countries and SIDS regions: every adaptation/mitigation project publicly listed, budget-traceable, community-checked, and integrity-safe—with a reusable multi-country SaaS / government-hosted option.

### 4.2 Success metrics (platform-level)

| Metric | Year-1 pilot target (per country) | Mature target |
|--------|-----------------------------------|---------------|
| % climate projects in scope publicly listed | ≥ 80% in pilot localities | ≥ 95% national |
| % projects with complete budget chain (approved/disbursed/spent) | ≥ 60% | ≥ 90% |
| Median time report → first official response | ≤ 10 working days | ≤ 5 working days |
| Integrity cases with status update to reporter | ≥ 90% | ≥ 95% |
| Citizen reports verified (not spam) | ≥ 70% actionable/verified | ≥ 80% |
| Open data consumers (API/download users) | ≥ 10 orgs | ≥ 50 orgs |
| Subnational entities actively updating | 2 pilots | National coverage |

---

## 5. Modular product architecture

Build as **pluggable modules**. Countries enable what they need; core remains shared.

## 6. Multi-country adaptability model

### 6.1 Design rule: one product, many country packs

Never fork the app per country. Ship:

| Layer | What varies by country | How configured |
|-------|------------------------|----------------|
| **Core platform** | Business logic, modules, security model | Shared release train |
| **Country pack** | Language, law text, boundaries, taxonomies, funders, hotlines | Config + content repo |
| **Integrations pack** | Budget systems, GIS, SMS gateway, ID systems | Connectors + credentials |
| **Governance pack** | Who handles cases, SLAs, escalation matrix | Policy config |
| **Hosting mode** | SaaS multi-tenant vs sovereign single-tenant | Deployment profile |

### 6.2 Country pack contents (checklist)

```
country-packs/<iso3166>/
  manifest.yml              # country meta, modules enabled, locales
  locales/                  # UI translations
  legal/
    privacy_notice.md
    whistleblower_guidance.md
    data_retention.yml
  geo/
    admin_boundaries.geojson  # or external source ref
    default_bbox.json
  taxonomies/
    sectors.yml
    delay_reasons.yml
    report_categories.yml
    climate_hazards.yml
  organizations/
    funders.yml
    ministries.yml
  integrity/
    escalation_matrix.yml
    handler_roles.yml
    legal_basis.yml
  branding/
    logo.svg
    theme.json
  open_data/
    license.yml
    redaction_rules.yml
```

### 6.3 Deployment profiles

| Profile | When to use | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| **A. Multi-tenant SaaS** | NGOs, multi-country programs, fast pilots | Strongest network effects; careful data residency |
| **B. Sovereign single-tenant** | Governments requiring in-country hosting | Same code; dedicated stack |
| **C. Hybrid** | Public zone SaaS + integrity vault on-prem / hardened host | Recommended for high-threat contexts |
| **D. Air-gapped integrity only** | Extreme threat models | Rare; public tracker still online |

### 6.4 Global standards mapping (portability)

| Domain | Preferred standards |
|--------|---------------------|
| Country / admin | ISO 3166; UNDP/GADM or national official boundaries |
| Climate finance activity | IATI activity standard (subset) + CFW extensions |
| Procurement / contracts | Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS) fields where available |
| Geospatial | GeoJSON; EPSG:4326; optional ISO 19115 metadata |
| Climate taxonomy | IPCC sectors + national climate budget tagging codes |
| Accessibility | WCAG 2.2 AA target |
| Security | OWASP ASVS L2+ for public; higher bar for integrity zone |

### 6.5 Localization beyond language

- Right-to-left scripts.  
- Local number/currency/date.  
- Low-literacy UX (icons, voice notes where appropriate).  
- Inclusive access: disability, gender-sensitive reporting paths.  
- Offline/assisted intake via CSO partners and local government kiosks.

## 7. Security & whistleblower architecture (two-zone)

### 7.1 Zone separation

```
                    ┌─────────────────────────────┐
   Citizens         │  PUBLIC ZONE                │
   Media/API   ───► │  Registry, budgets, maps,   │
   Councils         │  community evidence (PII-)  │
                    │  open API, scorecards       │
                    └──────────────▲──────────────┘
                                   │ NO shared user/case IDs
                    ┌──────────────┴──────────────┐
   Whistleblowers ─►│  TRUSTED ZONE               │
   Handlers         │  Anonymous intake           │
                    │  Encrypted case vault       │
                    │  Separate DB/keys/logs/VPC  │
                    └─────────────────────────────┘
```

### 7.2 Integrity zone requirements

| Control | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| Identity | No login required for submitters |
| Tracking | Random high-entropy case code only |
| Encryption | TLS in transit; field/attachment encryption at rest |
| Metadata | Strip EXIF; minimize IP retention; no marketing pixels |
| Access | Need-to-know RBAC; MFA; dual control for export |
| Logging | Immutable handler access audit |
| Hosting | Separate service and datastore from public app |
| Testing | External pen-test + abuse testing before go-live |
| Legal | Country-pack retention + lawful disclosure SOP |
| Tor | Onion service optional but recommended for high-risk reporters |

### 7.3 Recommended implementation approach

- **Do not build crypto messaging from scratch in Y1.**  
- Integrate a hardened open-source tip platform (**GlobaLeaks-class**) behind CFW UX, **or** implement an equivalent vault service with independent security review.  
- Public site deep-links to integrity intake without sharing cookies/analytics.  
- Case content never appears in public search indexes.

### 7.4 Threat model (summary)

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| Reporter re-identification | Anonymity defaults, metadata hygiene, no account graph |
| Compelled disclosure overreach | Minimize stored personal data; legal process SOP |
| Insider misuse by handlers | Dual control, audit logs, role separation |
| Fake reports / weaponization | Verification workflow; sanctions for proven abuse |
| DDoS / vandalism | WAF, rate limits, moderated public evidence |
| Supply-chain / hosting compromise | Separate zones, key management, least privilege |
| Government pressure to weaken anonymity | Governance charter; multi-party integrity oversight |

```

### 9.3 Non-functional requirements

| NFR | Target |
|-----|--------|
| Public page LCP | < 2.5s on 4G mid-tier mobile |
| API availability | 99.5% pilot; 99.9% national |
| Integrity availability | 99.5% with maintenance windows published |
| Backup RPO / RTO | Public: 24h / 8h; Integrity: 24h / 4h (policy-dependent) |
| Accessibility | WCAG 2.2 AA |
| Browser support | Last 2 versions Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Edge + progressive enhancement |
| Load | Design for 10× pilot peak at national scale without rewrite |
| Privacy | DPIA template; data minimization; retention jobs |

### 9.4 Media pipeline

1. Upload to temporary storage.  
2. Virus scan.  
3. EXIF/metadata strip (default on for community + integrity).  
4. Transcode/resize.  
5. Move to durable encrypted bucket.  
6. Generate public derivatives only for approved public evidence.

---

## 10. UX product surfaces

### 10.1 Public surfaces

1. **Home / country landing** — trust statement, totals, search.  
2. **Explore map** — primary mobile discovery.  
3. **Project page** — money, milestones, docs, community signals.  
4. **Follow the money** — funder → site chain.  
5. **My area** — geolocation or admin-unit picker.  
6. **Report evidence** — 60-second guided flow.  
7. **Integrity intake** — separate visual design; calm, privacy-first.  
8. **Scorecards** — monthly public performance.  
9. **Open data** — docs, swagger, downloads.  
10. **About / methodology / governance** — who runs it, how data is verified.

### 10.2 Authenticated surfaces

1. Local authority console.  
2. National portfolio console.  
3. Implementer contributor portal.  
4. Moderation / verification queue.  
5. Integrity handler console (trusted zone).  
6. Tenant admin / country pack manager.  
7. Platform ops admin.

### 10.3 UX principles

- Mobile-first; thumb-reachable primary actions.  
- Plain language (target CEFR B1 for citizen UI).  
- Progressive disclosure for complex budget data.  
- Explicit anonymity warnings and tips before integrity submit.  
- Works on low bandwidth (compressed maps, optional images).

## 13. Budget patterns (adaptable, not single-country fixed)

Use **modular cost envelopes** rather than one global price.

### 13.1 Reference envelopes (USD, indicative)

| Envelope | Pilot country (12 mo) | Each additional country (Y1) | Notes |
|----------|----------------------|------------------------------|-------|
| Product & engineering (core share) | 180k–280k | 20k–60k incremental | Core amortized across countries |
| Integrity security & isolation | 40k–90k | 15k–40k | Pen-test, hardening, vault ops |
| Hosting & observability | 20k–60k | 10k–40k | Depends on sovereign vs SaaS |
| Country pack + localization | 25k–70k | 25k–70k | Languages, legal, boundaries |
| Training & stakeholder engagement | 40k–90k | 30k–70k | Critical path for adoption |
| Pilot operations | 40k–80k | 30k–70k | Field support, helpdesk |
| MEL & knowledge | 20k–50k | 15k–35k | |
| Contingency (10–15%) | variable | variable | |
| **Total first country** | **~400k–700k** | | Mauritius reference ~550k fits |
| **Additional country** | | **~150k–350k** | If core already built |

### 13.2 Funding / sustainability models

1. **Public digital infrastructure** — government budget line + climate/governance grants.  
2. **Donor-funded pilots** — GCF readiness, bilateral governance funds, multi-lateral trust funds.  
3. **Freemium SaaS** — free public + citizen tools; paid advanced analytics for DFIs/auditors.  
4. **Regional shared service** — several SIDS share one operated instance with country packs.  
5. **Hybrid** — public core open source; paid hosting/support from a nonprofit or social enterprise operator.

**Pricing principle:** Citizens always free. Public climate project data always free. Never paywall transparency.

---

## 14. Governance model (global template)

### 14.1 Bodies

| Body | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Steering Committee** | Strategy, module priorities, major partnerships |
| **Data Governance Board** | Standards, quality, redaction disputes |
| **Integrity Oversight Panel** | Independent view on whistleblower SOPs and handler conduct |
| **Technical Advisory Group** | Architecture, security, open source |
| **Country Implementation Unit** | Day-to-day ops for a tenant |

### 14.2 Critical independence rule

The **integrity vault** must not be solely controlled by entities that are primary subjects of potential allegations. Options:

- Multi-signature administrative control (gov + CSO + independent tech).  
- Third-party nonprofit operator for trusted zone.  
- Statutory anti-corruption body as primary handler with published SLA metrics.

### 14.3 Policies every country must adopt (templates provided)

- Acceptable use & anti-abuse policy.  
- Community evidence moderation policy.  
- Whistleblower confidentiality & retaliation response SOP.  
- Data retention & deletion schedule.  
- Vulnerability disclosure policy.  
- Open data license & attribution.  
- Conflict of interest policy for handlers and admins.

---

## 15. Compliance & legal portability

Build a **compliance matrix** per country pack:

| Topic | Questions to resolve before launch |
|-------|------------------------------------|
| Privacy law | Lawful bases, DPIA, cross-border transfers |
| Whistleblower law | Protected categories, employer duties, anonymous tips legality |
| Defamation / false reports | Handling accusations before verification |
| Public finance disclosure | What must/can be published |
| Procurement secrecy | Contract field redaction rules |
| National security exceptions | Narrow, logged, time-bound |
| Records laws | Retention vs right to erasure tension |
| Child safety / CSAM | Media scanning obligations |
| Accessibility law | Public sector digital standards |

**Product stance:** maximum transparency for public fund data; maximum minimization for integrity identities.

---

## 16. Integration strategy

### 16.1 Priority connectors (build as adapters)

| System type | Examples (generic) | Phase |
|-------------|--------------------|-------|
| Spreadsheet/CSV | Ministry project lists | P1 |
| IATI feeds | Publisher datasets | P2–P3 |
| National budget / IFMIS | Treasury systems | P3–Y2 |
| Procurement portals | OCDS APIs | P3–Y2 |
| GIS / disaster risk | National DRM agencies, open hazard data | P2 |
| SMS gateways | Twilio, Africa’s Talking, local telco | P2 |
| WhatsApp Business | Meta Cloud API | P2 |
| Identity (staff) | Gov SSO, Azure AD, Keycloak | P1 |
| Document stores | SharePoint, national CMS | Y2 |

### 16.2 Integration principles

- Anti-corruption adapter pattern: normalize → validate → stage → publish.  
- Human-in-the-loop for first-time official data publishes.  
- Idempotent imports; full lineage (`source_system`, `source_id`, `imported_at`).

---

## 17. Analytics, AI, and automation (careful rollout)

| Capability | When | Guardrails |
|------------|------|------------|
| Rule-based delay alerts | P2 | Transparent rules published |
| Duplicate report clustering | P2 | Human moderation remains |
| Budget vs progress anomaly flags | Y2 | Explainable features only |
| NLP categorization of reports | Y2 | Human override; bias testing |
| Generative AI summaries for officers | Y2 optional | Never auto-decide integrity cases; never invent project facts |
| Face/re-ID in photos | **Do not ship** | Privacy harm outweighs benefit |

**Principle:** AI assists triage; humans own accountability decisions.

---

## 18. Testing, quality, and release management

### 18.1 Quality gates

- Unit + integration + contract tests for API.  
- End-to-end tests for citizen report and staff update flows.  
- Accessibility checks in CI.  
- Security SAST/DAST + dependency scanning.  
- Load tests before national launch.  
- Integrity zone: dedicated security regression suite.  
- Localization QA (linguistic + cultural).  
- Data quality score on imports (completeness, validity, timeliness).

### 18.2 Environments

`local → dev → staging (prod-like data synthetic) → production`  
Separate staging for integrity vault with production-like controls.

### 18.3 Release train

- Biweekly public platform releases after MVP.  
- Integrity changes: slower, security-reviewed cadence.  
- Feature flags for country-specific rollouts.

---

## 19. Operations & support model

| Function | Pilot | Scale |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Platform uptime monitoring | 8×5 | 24×7 on-call rotation |
| Citizen helpdesk | Email + partner CSOs | Multi-channel, multi-language |
| Officer support | Training + office hours | Tiered support |
| Integrity hotline support | Trained handlers only | Regional handler pools |
| Incident response | Security runbook | Tabletop exercises 2×/year |
| Data steward | Per country | Network of stewards |

**Public status page** recommended for trust.

---

## 20. MEL framework (Monitoring, Evaluation, Learning)

### 20.1 Indicator families

1. **Coverage** — projects listed, budget fields complete, geo completeness.  
2. **Use** — MAU citizens, officer active rates, API consumers.  
3. **Responsiveness** — report→ack→resolve times.  
4. **Integrity process health** — cases received, processed, status feedback rate (aggregates).  
5. **Outcomes** — reduced delay rates, corrective actions documented, trust surveys.  
6. **Inclusion** — reports by gender/region/language (voluntary, privacy-safe).  

### 20.2 Evaluation moments

- Baseline at pilot start.  
- Midline ~month 6–8.  
- Endline month 12.  
- Independent evaluation optional for donor programs.

### 20.3 Learning products

- Monthly internal ops review.  
- Quarterly public transparency bulletin.  
- Annual multi-country methods report.  
- Open post-mortems for major incidents (privacy-preserving).

---

## 21. Risk register (product delivery)

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Incomplete government data | High | High | Minimum templates; phased mandates; CSV bootstrap |
| Institutional resistance | Medium | High | Co-design; show operational value to councils |
| Integrity module security flaw | Low–Med | Critical | Isolation, pen-test, minimize data, bug bounty later |
| Low citizen uptake | Medium | High | CSO partners, SMS, radio, local language, offline help |
| Report weaponization | Medium | Medium | Verification, moderation, legal deterrents for malice |
| Scope creep (AI, native apps, DRM) | High | Medium | Modular roadmap; protect MVP |
| Multi-country config forks | Medium | High | Enforce country packs; no per-country code branches |
| Hosting data residency conflicts | Medium | High | Deployment profiles A–D |
| Funding cliff after pilot | Medium | High | Institutionalization plan from month 1 |
| Greenwashing score disputes | Medium | Low–Med | Transparent methodology; appeal process |

---

## 24. Go-to-market & adoption (country-agnostic)

### 24.1 Launch sequence

1. Soft launch with local officers (data quality first).  
2. CSO verifier onboarding.  
3. Public launch with media kit and open data.  
4. Integrity channel announced with clear safety guidance.  
5. First monthly scorecard within 60 days of public launch.

### 24.2 Adoption levers

- Make council dashboards useful for **their** meetings (not only public shaming).  
- Celebrate data completeness publicly (positive incentives).  
- Partner with universities for independent analysis.  
- Integrate into donor reporting requirements where possible.  
- Radio/IVR campaigns for low-connectivity areas.

### 24.3 Messaging pillars

1. Trace every climate unit of currency to a place and result.  
2. Communities are sensors of implementation reality.  
3. Safe reporting protects public funds and honest officials.  
4. Open data multiplies accountability beyond the platform.  
5. Built once, configurable everywhere.

---

## 25. Open source & digital public good strategy

**Recommended stance:**

| Component | License direction |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Public tracker application | Open source (e.g., AGPL or MPL) after pilot stabilization |
| Data schemas & country pack examples | Creative Commons / open schema |
| Integrity vault | Prefer existing OSS; publish hardening guides |
| Operational runbooks | Public where safe |
| Security-sensitive configs | Private |

Benefits: trust, reuse across countries, external audits, lower long-term cost for SIDS.

---

## 26. Second-country readiness checklist

A new country may start when:

- [ ] Core MVP in production in country #1 for ≥3 months.  
- [ ] Country pack schema stable (no weekly breaking changes).  
- [ ] At least one non-English localization proven.  
- [ ] Integrity SOP templates validated with legal review process.  
- [ ] Hosting profile docs complete (SaaS / sovereign / hybrid).  
- [ ] Onboarding runbook used once end-to-end.  
- [ ] Cost model for incremental country approved.  
- [ ] Support capacity exists (or regional partner contracted).  

---

## 27. Mauritius reference mapping (optional first tenant)

Use existing concept assets as **Country Pack MU** seed:

| Existing asset | Maps to |
|----------------|---------|
| Idea / concept notes | Product modules M1–M8 |
| Pitch deck outline | Go-to-market + 12-month pilot |
| Budget ~USD 550k | First-country envelope (§13) |
| Pilot: 2 councils | Phase 2 subnational scope |
| Flood/cyclone focus | Hazard taxonomy + risk layers |
| Local council portals | M6 |
| Whistleblower channel | M5 |
| Open data/API | M7 |

Mauritius remains the **reference implementation**, not the product boundary.
