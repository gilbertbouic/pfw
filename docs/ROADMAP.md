# Public Funds Watch — Build roadmap (thin slice)

> **Live site (2026-10):** https://pfw.mkweli.tech on GitHub Pages. The phases below record the earlier Climate Fund Watch build. The live registry is external public funding for Mauritius, with climate as one sector.

This roadmap adapts [`PRODUCT_BUILD_PLAN.md`](../PRODUCT_BUILD_PLAN.md) for practical sequential delivery. The full plan remains the north star (modules, two-zone security, multi-tenant country packs).

## Principle

Ship a **credible public face + demo tracker** first. Keep architecture decisions compatible with multi-country and two-zone security. Defer integrity vault, staff auth, and live government integrations until legal review and pilot partners exist.

## Phases

### Phase A — Repo hygiene *(done)*

- [x] Connect workspace to `gilbertbouic/cfw`
- [x] Keep product build plan at repo root
- [x] Organize Mauritius materials under `docs/mauritius/`
- [x] Document thin-slice roadmap

### Phase B — Public narrative site

**Audience:** citizens & media (also useful for funders)

- [x] Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind app in `web/`
- [x] Landing (problem, modules, build path CTAs)
- [x] About (product definition, audiences, principles, MU pilot)
- [x] Problem & Solution (failure modes, modules, user flow)
- [x] Get involved (partnership paths + contact stub)
- [x] Deploy to Vercel (see README)
- [ ] Confirm public contact email and custom domain

### Phase C — Public sourced tracker *(current)*

- [x] Project TypeScript schema (nullable money fields, required sources)
- [x] Sourced Mauritius ledger (no synthetic local projects)
- [x] Project list + detail pages with citations
- [x] Filters (geography, status, hazard, funder, objective, search)
- [x] MapLibre map only for sourced / labelled pins
- [x] Sources page (methodology redirects here)
- [x] CSV download + JSON API with source URLs
- [x] Landscape page: need vs tagged spend vs donor channels

### Phase D — Community evidence (light)

- [ ] Report wizard (categories from product plan Appendix A)
- [ ] Photo upload pipeline (scan + EXIF strip later)
- [ ] Operator inbox (email or simple admin) before full console

### Phase E — Institutional & integrity (funded / partners)

Follow product plan Phases 1–3:

- Integrity vault (M5) with pen-test
- Council / national consoles (M6)
- RBAC + MFA
- SMS/WhatsApp bridges as needed
- Live pilot in ≥2 subnational units

## Stack (locked for Phase B–C)

| Layer | Choice |
|-------|--------|
| Public web | Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind |
| Demo data | Static JSON/CSV in repo (no DB required for C) |
| Maps (Phase C) | MapLibre GL + OSM |
| Later API/DB | NestJS or FastAPI + PostgreSQL/PostGIS (per build plan) |

## Exit criteria

| Phase | Done when |
|-------|-----------|
| B | Stakeholders can share a live URL explaining problem, solution, and pilot intent |
| C | Media/citizen can browse demo projects on list + map and download open data |
| D | A field report can be submitted and received by an operator |
| E | Real pilot geography with real users and integrity SOP |
